<h2>Download</h2>
You can get the latest release from <a href="https://github.com/Sentinent/BrawlhallaPingOverlay/releases/latest">here</a>. (You only need to download the .exe)

<h2>Usage</h2>
The latest release will be a pre-compiled executable with the libraries bundled together. To use it, simply download and run the executable. 

Once launched, the tool will be in a blank state with no servers selected. To get started, press the "Settings" button and select the servers you want enabled. Then to enable the in-game overlay, go to the "Overlay Settings" tab and click on the "Overlay Enabled" button. Once in game, colored ping numbers should start to show up (see screenshots). If they do not appear, alt+tab to a window called "Overlay". To move the ping numbers around, hold your left shift key and drag them around with your mouse. 

That's pretty much all there is to the tool, there's a few more customization options available in the settings for you to play with, enjoy!
